# neural_net_id_objects
I use the existing MaskRCNN resnet50 in pytorch on a custom image set to highlight people, cars and buses in the image. I'm thinking of either trying to figure out the orientation of each of these objects in the image or to classify the image as either urban/suburban/rural in my next project

Below are some highlights of this project so far
